# Use expert knowledge instead of data: generating hints for hour of code exercises
## Autonomous hint generation model in Haskell

This model contains various Haskell files. Below you will find a description per file what it does. The list is in order of importance.

| Filename                | Description |
| --------                | ------------- |
| strategy.hs             | MAIN FILE. Contains all the magic. |
| expression.hs           | Contains functions that deal with expression manipulation.  |
| auxiliary.hs            | Contains helper functions. You name it and it may or may not be there. See for yourself. |
| gridHandler.hs          | All games are grid based and in this file the low-level grid handling function reside. | 
| jsonreader.hs           | Reads the AST's from the data folder from Piech's source. |
|  |  |
| hatex.hs  | This file generates latex code |
| dirtree.hs    | This file helps generate dirtree code|
| forest.hs     | This file helps generate Tikz's forests.|
